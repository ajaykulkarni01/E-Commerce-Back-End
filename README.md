# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)

## Description
Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. 

The task for this project includes building the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
